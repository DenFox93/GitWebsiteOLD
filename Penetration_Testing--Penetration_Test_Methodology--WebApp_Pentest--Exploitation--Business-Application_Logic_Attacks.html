The difficulty in discovering these types of flaws is particularly true for automated scanning tools. One of the major challenges faced by automated tools in discovering these flaws is lack of understanding the context of an application<br /><br /><strong>Logic Flaws: Workflow Tampering</strong><br />Find any functionality that has an expected flow and break it down into its constituent parts. Once the typical workflow and steps are understood, we can attempt to subvert them in various ways.<br /><br /><strong>Logic Flaws: Manual Discovery</strong><br />Because as said earlier every automated scanning tool has tremendous difficulty in identifying these flaws. Manual testing for and discovery of these flaws will typically be required if this type of testing is part of the engagement.<br />Burp Repeater, with its interception proxy capabilities, often seems particularly well suited for manual logic flaw testing<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">OWASP Test cases to identify business logic flaws (Starting Point)</span><br />4.10.1 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/01-Test_Business_Logic_Data_Validation">Test Business Logic Data Validation</a><br />4.10.2 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/02-Test_Ability_to_Forge_Requests">Test Ability to Forge Requests</a><br />4.10.3 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/03-Test_Integrity_Checks">Test Integrity Checks</a><br />4.10.4 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/04-Test_for_Process_Timing">Test for Process Timing</a><br />4.10.5 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/05-Test_Number_of_Times_a_Function_Can_Be_Used_Limits">Test Number of Times a Function Can Be Used Limits</a><br />4.10.6 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/06-Testing_for_the_Circumvention_of_Work_Flows">Testing for the Circumvention of Work Flows</a><br />4.10.7 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/07-Test_Defenses_Against_Application_Misuse">Test Defenses Against Application Misuse</a><br />4.10.8 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/08-Test_Upload_of_Unexpected_File_Types">Test Upload of Unexpected File Types</a><br />4.10.9 <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/09-Test_Upload_of_Malicious_Files">Test Upload of Malicious Files</a><br /><br /><strong>What we need to look</strong><br />• new features which interact with old features<br />• able to sign up for an account with the email example@target.com.
